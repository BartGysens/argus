**Installation:

AZ Index is an extension to the argus - a Quality control extension.

1. Unpack the argus_azindex folder and contents in the appropriate modules
directory of your Drupal installation.  This is probably sites/all/modules/

 **Feeding the list with links:

 The list of links is generated by default from menu-items which are placed under
 the Modules menu.
 
 A menu-item has to be expanded to get displayed.
 
 You can also add menu-items from pages and articles by placing them as a child
 under the Modules menu.
 
 **Important notice:
 
 You should create a menu called Modules (modules) for this module to work.
