**Installation:

Smartschool API is an extension to the Smartschool platform from the argus
extension suite for Smartschool.
You must have a working account and administration access.

1. Unpack the argus_sms_api folder and contents in the appropriate modules
directory of your Drupal installation.  This is probably
  sites/all/modules/
2. Enable the argus_sms_api module in the administration tools.
3. If you're not using Drupal's default administrative account, make
sure "administer smartschool" is enabled through access control administration.
4. Visit the argus_buscheck settings page and make appropriate configurations
 at admin > argus > Smartschool API: /admin/config/argus/smartschool-api
